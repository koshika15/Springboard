    "# Hospital Readmissions Data Analysis and Recommendations for Reduction\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "In October 2012, the US government's Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) began reducing Medicare payments for Inpatient Prospective Payment System hospitals with excess readmissions. Excess readmissions are measured by a ratio, by dividing a hospital’s number of “predicted” 30-day readmissions for heart attack, heart failure, and pneumonia by the number that would be “expected,” based on an average hospital with similar patients. A ratio greater than 1 indicates excess readmissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise Directions\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you will:\n",
    "+ critique a preliminary analysis of readmissions data and recommendations (provided below) for reducing the readmissions rate\n",
    "+ construct a statistically sound analysis and make recommendations of your own \n",
    "\n",
    "More instructions provided below. Include your work **in this notebook and submit to your Github account**. \n",
